This is the firmware for the Electronic Chaos System.

The firmware can be built using MPLAB and the C32 compiler from 
Microchip. It was originally built in MPLAB 8.46, but other versions
should work as well.

The version 2d board can be programmed using a PICKit3. The programming
header is J10. Pin 1 on the PICKit3 (the white arrow) goes to pin 1 on 
the header.
